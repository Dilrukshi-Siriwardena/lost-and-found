**Authentication**

Axios instance with JWT support (api/axios.ts)

Login & Signup pages with token storage

ProtectedRoute for private routes

Token is stored in localStorage and automatically attached to API requests.

**Routing**

All routes are defined in routes/AppRoutes.tsx.

/login → Login page

/signup → User registration

/dashboard → Protected dashboard (requires login)

**CRUD Operations**

Example: List reported items in Dashboard

useEffect(() => {
  API.get("/items").then((res) => setItems(res.data));
}, []);


Users can:

Report items (POST)

Update item status (PUT/PATCH)

Delete items (DELETE)

 **UI/UX Best Practices**
Consistent TailwindCSS components (bg-blue-500, rounded-xl, shadow-md)

Responsive design with sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints

Clean layout with reusable components
